# Sign Language Recognition Project

This project aims to develop a sign language recognition system using TensorFlow, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. The system will allow users to communicate with machines by using hand gestures in sign language. The recognition model will be trained using a dataset of hand gestures, and the system will be able to translate sign language into text.
